# Additional configuration for adding Proxy-support in ISD
# 
# For ISD to work behind a proxy, we need to do the following
# a) Ensure that proxy/no-proxy values are updated in values.yaml
# b) in gitops repo, defaults/service-settings, each of the Spinnaker services should have proxy/no-proxy configured
#    Note that all ISD services must be listed in the no-proxy list
extraEnvVars:
  - name: JAVA_OPTS
    value: -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.server.local -Dhttps.proxyPort=3128
